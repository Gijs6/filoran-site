*Filoran* is the name of our fictional country that we are making for civics (*maatschappijleer*) at our school. We decided to make a website from the government of Filoran, and this is that site.

When deciding on the name of our country, we kept in mind that the first two letters should be an already existing ccTLD, so that we could register a domain that would actually look like they are from our country, **so .fi is for the country of Filoran, sorry Finland**.

The site is a simple Jekyll site, with custom CSS as theme.
